 Like many stories, my story starts in Rahway, New Jersey, a place  not many people are familiar with. When I was younger, my dad, Fred, worked hard to support his family, and my mother, Kimberly, stayed at home. I am the third of four children, three of whom are boys, and, you got it, I was the only girl.
